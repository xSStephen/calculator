# calculator

A new Flutter project.
For my first solo project I want to create a basic calculator app. The app will have a simple user interface with buttons for numbers and operations. The app will perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app will also have a clear button to reset the calculator.

This started as a simple calculator but I've wanted to learn about API, so I've added a currency exchange tool too using URL: app.exchangerate-api.com
